SYNOPSIS


DESCRIPTION


Format of the format string


Length modifier
       Here, "integer conversion" stands for d, i, o, u, x, or X
       conversion.

Conversion specifiers
       A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
       The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

	   c      If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted
              to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is
              written.  If an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide
              character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by
              a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state
              starting in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte
              string is written.
